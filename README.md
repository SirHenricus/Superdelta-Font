# Superdelta-Font

Hello. This is just a custom font that I made around October 26, 2023 for some other project.
I don't quite remember what that website I used to make it, but I know the font was inspired by "BOILED TRUNK", which was a font used
in the Pygame Project "Project T.R.U.N.K" by Kadable, so I likely used the same font maker site that they were using. 
Apologies if the repo isn't made very well, I'm still learning how to make repos :P
